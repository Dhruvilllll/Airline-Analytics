# Airline-Analytics
Just found a dataset of China and thought to analyze it
You can find the dataset on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashantverma13/airline-data-analysis-using-sql/input)

### Key Obstacles
**Stricter environmental regulations:** The airlines industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also restrict the potential for expansion.

**Higher flight taxes:** Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft as a means to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. This increase in flight taxes has raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

**Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs:** The aviation sector is experiencing a scarcity of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and an increase in turnover rates.
